## OpenNEM: an open platform for National Electricity Market Data
The **OpenNEM project** aims to make the wealth of public **National Electricity Market (NEM)** data more accessible to a wider audience.

We hope that improved access will facilitate **better public understanding of the market, improve energy literacy** and help facilitate a more **informed national discussion** on Australia’s energy transition in the long term interests of consumers.

By providing a **clear** window on the data, we hope to address the information asymmetry between stakeholders and improve the productivity of those engaged in energy market discussions.

OpenNEM is a project of the [Energy Transition Hub](http://energy-transition-hub.org/).
